Even though the demand for IT professionals isn't as high as it was during the pandemic, the field still offers the work-life balance that many people want. One area where we have experience is web development, which offers many different career opportunities.

Web development isn't just for programmers; there are many different roles you can take on in this field. In this blog post, we want to create a list of web development jobs to make it easy for interested people to understand and see the options available.

First up is the business analyst. As a business analyst in web development, your job is to understand what the client or business needs and turn those needs into technical requirements. This means working with different people to gather information and then using that information to create detailed instructions for building the website or application. To do well in this role, you need to be good at solving problems, understanding how businesses work, and communicating clearly with both technical and non-technical team members.

Next is the UI-UX designer. This role is all about how the website or application looks and feels to the user. As a UI-UX designer, you'll create design sketches, mockups, and prototypes, and work with developers to make sure the final product is user-friendly. To succeed in this role, you need a good eye for design, an understanding of how users interact with websites, and skills in design tools like Figma and Sketch.

Another important role is the architect. As a web architect, you'll design the overall structure of the website or application, making sure everything works together smoothly. This includes creating diagrams and technical documents that show how the different parts of the website will fit together. 
To do well in this role, you need a good understanding of web technologies, usually gained from working as a developer for a few years. You also need to think about how everything fits together and be able to solve tricky problems.
